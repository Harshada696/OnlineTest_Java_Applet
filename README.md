# 🎓 OnlineTest_Java_Applet

Welcome to **OnlineTest_Java_Applet**, a Java Swing-based desktop application that simulates an interactive online quiz platform. It supports subject-based quizzes like **HTML**, **Java**, **Python**, and **CSS**, providing a friendly UI, quick feedback, and an engaging test environment — all built with Java and Applet fundamentals.

✅ Interactive GUI using **Java Swing & AWT**  
✅ Instant scoring and feedback  
✅ Bookmark questions to revisit later  
✅ Randomized score logic (for demonstration)  
✅ Simple layout and smooth navigation
